# Feeds
This directory contains all the RSS feeds related to AMS Council.
- `agenda-feed.rss` includes the full text of AMS Council agendas and links to supporting documents. It is updated once a day Thursday-Sunday and every six hours Monday-Wednesday (to account for retrieving agendas in the days before a Wednesday council meeting being more timely)

## Future Feeds
It's likely that I'll make a [Sheldon's Council Summaries](https://www.ams.ubc.ca/about-us/student-council/agendas-presentations-minutes/agendas-presentations-minutes-2025/) feed at some point soon.
Those summaries are actually regularly uploaded soon after a council meeting.

The following feeds have been considered for future implementation, but are followed with with some excuses for why they probably won't be implemented (mostly because of Transparency Ls):
- AMS Council Minutes. These are published infrequently, in batches of months of minutes at a time, and parsing the PDFs is likely to be very difficult and inconsistent. 
- Committee Agendas. These just straight up aren't posted on the committee pages. The most recent agendas from most of these are from 2023
- Committee Minutes. As above, they just really aren't posted. I'd love to do all of these, but you know. Transparency is a thing in the AMS.
