# AMS Council RSS Feed
An RSS feed generator for the Agenda of UBC's Alma Mater Society Council.

## Accessing the Feed
The AMS Agenda RSS Feed is temporarily hosted at https://qsolace.github.io/ams-council-rss/feeds/agenda-feed.rss.

## Warning
This feed is currently _extremely_ fragile. It relies on the exact structure of the AMS website and the (incredibly 
loose) agenda naming standards I was able to deduce. If the AMS changes how they present the council agenda (even slightly),
this feed probably breaks. So... yay that :)
