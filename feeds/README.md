# Feeds
This directory contains all the RSS feeds related to AMS Council.
- `agenda-feed.rss` includes the full text of AMS Council agendas and links to supporting documents. It is updated once a day Thursday-Sunday and every three hours Monday-Wednesday (to account for retrieving agendas in the days before a Wednesday council meeting being more timely)

## Future Feeds
The following feeds are being considered for future implementation, along with some excuses for why they probably won't be implemented:
- AMS Council Minutes. These are published infrequently, in batches of months of minutes at a time, and parsing the PDFs is likely to be very difficult and inconsistent. 
- Committee Agendas. These just straight up aren't posted on the committee pages. The most recent agendas from most of these are from 2023
- Committee Minutes. As above, they just really aren't posted. I'd love to do all of these, but you know. Transparency is a thing in the AMS.
